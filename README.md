# Head_pose-and-Blink-Detector

With this simple code I propose a Head_pose estimator along with Blink deetction and depth estimation with Mediapipe and a laptop webcam.
All the estimations are made by assuming a pinhole camera model for the webcam and considering a iris diameter of 11.7 mm as indicated in the Mediapipe documemntation https://research.google/blog/mediapipe-iris-real-time-iris-tracking-depth-estimation/.
